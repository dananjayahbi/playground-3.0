      Depression affects millions globally, yet traditional diagnostic methods
      rely on subjective self-reports, leading to delays and inaccuracies.
      Automated systems leveraging behavioral cues like facial expressions offer
      a promising alternative. This paper isolates and refines the facial
      expression analysis component from a broader multimodal framework to
      create a specialized solution for depression detection. By integrating
      computer vision technologies, the proposed system enables continuous,
      non-intrusive monitoring of emotional states, facilitating early
      intervention. The depression mapping algorithm further enhances clinical
      relevance by translating multimodal emotional data into standardized
      severity levels.

      Recent studies highlight the efficacy of AI in detecting depression
      through facial cues. Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) systems, such as
      those developed by Affectiva and RealEyes, use deep learning to identify
      microexpressions linked to depressive states. EfficientNet-B2, a
      lightweight model, balances computational efficiency and accuracy, making
      it suitable for real-time applications. This paper addresses these gaps by
      combining facial modalities with a robust depression severity mapping
      algorithm.

      The facial emotion recognition module processes real-time webcam footage
      using OpenCV and PyTorch, following a structured pipeline for accurate
      emotion classification. First, the preprocessing stage ensures frame
      alignment, resizing (224x224 pixels), and normalization for consistent
      input quality. Next, feature extraction leverages EfficientNet-B2 and
      FaceNet-PyTorch to analyze spatial features from the face, capturing
      fine-grained facial expressions. A Softmax layer then classifies the
      extracted features into seven emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, fear,
      surprise, disgust, and neutrality by outputting confidence scores between
      0 and 1. These emotion scores, along with timestamps, are stored locally
      for longitudinal trend analysis, enabling insights into emotional patterns
      over time. Additionally, when emotional intensity surpasses critical
      thresholds (e.g., sadness > 0.7), alerts are triggered to detect severe
      depression in accordance with MADRS guidelines.

      The Depression Mapping Algorithm integrates emotional confidence scores
      from facial modalities using weighted averaging, where weights are
      assigned based on clinical relevance detected in facial expressions. This
      combined score is then used to classify depression severity into three
      levels: mild (0.5–0.7), moderate (0.7–0.85), and severe (>0.85). These
      thresholds are aligned with MADRS guidelines, ensuring clinically
      actionable insights for early detection and intervention in mental health
      assessments.

    This paper presents a robust framework for depression detection using
    facial expression analysis. The integration of EfficientNet,
    FaceNet-PyTorch, and hybrid CNN-LSTM models achieves high accuracy in
    emotion classification, while the MADRS-aligned mapping algorithm enhances
    clinical utility. Future work will focus on expanding datasets to include
    diverse demographics and optimizing real-time performance for scalable
    deployment. This approach bridges the gap between traditional diagnostics
    and AI-driven solutions, offering a proactive tool for mental health
    management.
